# FourierDrawing
A smaller js version I made can be found here: [https://maximemunari.fr/fourier.html](https://maxmnr.github.io/fourier-js/)

Delve into the depths of Fourier Analysis interactively. This application empowers users to sketch any shape and witness the signal's reconstruction through FFT, presented in a uniquely captivating manner. The use also has the possibility of importing a svg file and using Bezier Curves the path can be reconstructed before applying Fourier Analysis.
