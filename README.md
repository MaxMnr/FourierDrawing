# FourierDrawing
Delve into the depths of Fourier Analysis interactively. This application empowers users to sketch any shape and witness the signal's reconstruction through FFT, presented in a uniquely captivating manner. The use also has the possibility of importing a svg file and using Bezier Curves the path can be reconstructed before applying Fourier Analysis.

This code has been realised in the context of a class of Python for Physicists.

## Required Packages:

- tkinter
- numpy
